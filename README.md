Sometimes it is very frustrating programming in C language, when you already know some great features of C + +. It's even worse when you are programming for embedded applications, where you can not use malloc. I got one of these cases, when I tried to create a queue of strings and use it more than once and with different sizes. Qwoma means Queue Without Memory Allocation (malloc) and allows you to give to the queue the matrix that will be used to access the data. With this, you can define how many characters queue lines will have and also how many lines it'll have.
